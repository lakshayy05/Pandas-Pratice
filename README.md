# Pandas-Pratice

# Pandas Fundamentals & Data Analysis 🐼

A structured collection of **Pandas** exercises and implementations, demonstrating proficiency in Data Manipulation, Cleaning, and Analysis. This repository serves as a practical guide to handling structured data in Python, a core skill for Data Science.

The notebook moves from basic data structures to advanced data transformation techniques, simulating real-world data preprocessing workflows.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered

This notebook explores the extensive capabilities of the Pandas library:

* **Data Structures:** Creating and manipulating **Series** and **DataFrames** from scratch and external sources (CSV/Excel).
* **Data Inspection:** Utilizing methods like `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, and `dtypes` to understand dataset characteristics.
* **Selection & Indexing:** extracting specific data subsets using `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`, and conditional filtering.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (`isna`, `fillna`, `dropna`) and removing duplicates to ensure data quality.
* **Data Transformation:** Renaming columns, changing data types, and applying functions using `.apply()` and `.map()`.
* **Aggregation & Grouping:** Using `groupby()` and pivot tables to summarize data and derive insights.
* **Merging & Joining:** (Optional - check if you covered this) Combining multiple datasets using `merge()` and `concat()`.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes practical examples of EDA, where raw data is transformed into meaningful insights. It demonstrates how to:
1.  Filter data based on complex conditions.
2.  Calculate statistical summaries (Mean, Median, Mode) for specific groups.
3.  Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.13.3
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
